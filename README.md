* Tensorflow version: 1.4.1

## How to run
* The script for running this model with dataset citeulike-a is main_citeulike_a.py, while main_cora.py is for running with cora dataset
* To pretrain the model, set the mode as 1 in main file
* After pretraining, set the mode as 2 to finetune the model

## Remarks
